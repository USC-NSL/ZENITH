Liveness;
1. only the correct DAG is eventually installed. 
(All the IRs corresponding to the correct DAG are installed in the TCAMs, 
and there is no extra IR in any of the TCAMs)
2. IRs of the correct DAG have eventually IR_DONE flag in NIB.

Safety; 
1. No two workers working on the same IR. 
2. No Redundant Installation (If the status of IR becomes IR_DONE for the first time, it should always remain IR_DONE)
3. No violation of dependency graph of IRs for any DAG.
4. Each IR is installed at most once.
