# TLA+ Specifications of `ZENITH`

This repository contains all iterations of the `ZENITH` controller specifications.

Each directory contains a verified `ZENITH` specification for a different scenario, but the final version of `ZENITH` that we implement our code with are under the `Eval` directory.

We strongly suggest using the TLA+ Jar file directly for verification, as the scripts for using it are already written under `Eval`.
