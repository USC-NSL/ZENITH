Bug#1 (deadlock in Failover): Failover module receives the failover request and sends FAILOVER_INIT signal to OFC1 → 
RCS Sequencer schedules an IR for sw0 → OFC1 NIB event handler receives the notification and schedules the role update 
request for sw0 → OFC0 NIB event handler receives the notification for the new IR and passes the IR to workers → OFC0 
worker forwards the IR to sw0 → sw0 receives the IR, successfully installs the IR, and sends the confirmation to OFC0 
→ sw0 CPU fails → OFC0 changes the flag of IR to IR_DONE → sw0 CPU recovers →  OFC0 topo event handler receives the 
notification about sw0 failure and suspends the sw0 (both in NIB, and its local) → OFC1 worker does not forward the 
role-req since its switch is suspended


+ Problem: The problem is Failover is not finished successfully since OFC1 is waiting for all the switches to have 
ROLE_EQUAL. 

+ Solution: OFC1 should skip failed switches, and get back to them when they are recovered. The OF event handler upon 
recovery of a switch checks if it is the master of the switch or not. If it is not, it schedules a role update msg to 
update its role to ROLE_MASTER.

Bug#2 (permission and synchronizatoin issue): Failover module receives the failover request and sends the FAILOVER_INIT 
signal to OFC1 → OFC1 NIB event handler receives the notification and schedules the role update request for sw0 → OFC1 
worker forwards the role request (ROLE_EQUAL) msg to sw0 → sw0 receives the packet → sw0 CPU fails → OFC1 OpenFlow 
event handler receives the event and suspends the switch (both in NIB and its local) → sw0 CPU recovers → OFC1 NIB 
event handler skips role update in sw0 as it is suspended, synchronizes its local IRQueue with IRQueue in NIB and 
changes its failover status to FAILOVER_READY → failover module receives the notification and sends FAILOVER_TERMINATE
signal to OFC0 → OFC0 NIB event handler sends termination signal to workers, and they terminate gracefully → OFC1 
OpenFlow event handler receives the switch recovery event → Since its role in switch is ROLE_SLAVE, OFC1 OpenFlow 
event handler schedules a role update request msg (ROLE_MASTER) → OFC1 worker forwards the role request msg to sw0 → 
sw0 updates the roles (OFC1 |→ ROLE_MASTER, OFC0 |→ ROLE_SLAVE) and replies with confirmation msg → OFC0 NIB event 
handler processes the sw failure event and changes the switch status to SW_SUSPEND → OFC1 monitoring server receives 
the role update confirmation msg and updates its role in NIB to ROLE_MASTER → OFC0 NIB event handler sends termination 
signal to monitoring server and OF event handler, and they terminate. → OFC0 NIB event handler changes its failover 
status in NIB to FAILOVER_TERMINATE_DONE → Failover module changes OFC roles in NIB

+ Problem: IR is not installed in the switch since the status of the sw is SW_SUSPEND in NIB while the switch is 
actually working correctly. 

+ Solution: Only the master OFC should be able to make topology modifications and needs a way to synchronize the 
events between different OFCs.
