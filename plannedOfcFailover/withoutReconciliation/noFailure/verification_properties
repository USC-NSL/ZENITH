Liveness;
1. All IRs are eventually installed.
2. IRs have entually IR_DONE status in NIB.
3. If SHOULD_FAILOVER=1;
	3.1. all switches should eventually have the correct master.
	3.2. the masterState in NIB should eventually be correct.

Safety;
1. No two workers working on the same IR. 
2. No Redundant Installation (If the status IR becomes IR_DONE for the first time, it should always remain IR_DONE)
3. No violation of dependency graph
4. correctness of failover;
	4.1. Each IR should be installed by at most one OFC
5. Each switch should have at most one master.
