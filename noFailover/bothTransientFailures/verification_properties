Liveness;
1. All IRs are eventually installed.
2. IRs have eventually IR_DONE flag in NIB.

Safety; 
1. No two workers working on the same IR. 
2. No Redundant Installation (If the status of IR becomes IR_DONE for the first time, it should always remain IR_DONE)
3. No violation of dependency graph of IRs.
